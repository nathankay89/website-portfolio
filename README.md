## Description

What I have built is an interactive portfolio website that demonstrates the skills that I have currently acquired from the bootcamp course. I have built this to show the basic concepts of HTML and CSS that I have learned over the last two weeks. This website is the first draft of many that will show me and my future employer the capabilities of my knowledge. All of the knowledge that I have implemented has been shown to me within the last few weeks as I had no coding knowledge prior to this course.
