## Description

What I have build is an interactive portfolio website that demonstates the skills that I have currently aquired from the bootcamp course. I have built this to show the basic concepts of HTML and CSS that I have learned over the last 2 weeks. This website is the first draft of many that with show me and my future employer the capabilites of me knowledge. All of the knowlege that I have implimented has been shown to me within the last few weeks as I had no coding knowledge prior to this course.
